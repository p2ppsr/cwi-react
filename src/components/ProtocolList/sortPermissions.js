/**
 * Sorts and groups an array of permissions by domain and counterparty.
 *
 * This function takes an array of permission objects and organizes them into a nested structure
 * based on the domain and counterparty values. It groups permissions by domain and then by
 * counterparty within each domain, ensuring that each counterparty is listed only once per domain.
 *
 * This allows permissions to be revoked on a per-counterparty basis.
 *
 * @param {Array} permissions - An array of permission objects to be sorted and grouped.
 *
 * @returns {Array} An array of objects, each representing a domain with its unique permissions
